#### Getting Started

Clone or pull this project to your local machine and run ```npm install```.

I recommend using the live-server npm module in order to view any updates you make to the code. Simply do ```npm install live-server``` and then run the application from the src folder by typing ```live-server```

This project was built with the help of the gulp taskrunner. The ```gulp watch``` task will automatically watch the components directory for any changes to *.js files and will automatically bundle them into the dist folder. It will also watch our style.scss file and compile that to css for us should there be any changes made to that.

#### More Tutorials

This project was built with the intention of being an educational showcase for how to build component based applications in angularjs 1.5.8. 

Tutorials based on this application will be added to [TutorialEdge](https://tutorialedge.net).
